Kolmogorov Arold Networks for XOR Gate Realization June 2024 —

+ Investigate the potential of Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) in solving the YOR problem by demonstrating that single neuron
setup was inadequate, and transitioned to 3 (21,1) structure forimproved performance.

+ Leveraged & splines in KAN to introduce necessary nomtinearity, adjusting splines usinga least squares solution to enhance
network performance andinterpretabilty. Acieved accurate XOR problem resolution, validating the practical vibilty of AN over
traditional MPs,
